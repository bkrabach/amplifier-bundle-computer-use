"""Gate test for layer 3 of the anti-regression scheme
(docs/multi-provider-design.md Sec 11.2) - the dated wire attestation
`scripts/wire_check.py` produces in `tests/fixtures/wire-check.json`.

The design doc originally specified this layer as advisory: "it records; it
does not assert" - CI prints the attestation's age and a human is expected to
notice. The six-lens review (docs/phase2-plans.md, "Council items
still open") named this as reproducing, by a different name, the exact
failure the layer exists to catch: 393 green unit tests and a green 4-stage
chain test, all sitting on a wire nobody had actually exercised, while the
live API rejected every request. This test IS the fix - it turns "prints; a
human notices" into "the suite goes red."

Pure logic, no network: this test only inspects the JSON attestation file
`scripts/wire_check.py` writes. It runs the same in CI (no keys, no network,
`ubuntu-latest` with no display - see CONTRIBUTING.md) as anywhere else,
which is the whole point - a check that can only pass online is a check that
gets disabled the first time CI has no network. Refreshing the attestation
(running `scripts/wire_check.py` with real API keys) is a separate,
periodic, human/CI-with-secrets action, in the same family as
`scripts/verify_coexistence.py` (CONTRIBUTING.md, "The ship gate"); THIS test
enforces that someone actually did it recently enough to trust.

#: How long a wire attestation may go unrefreshed before the suite treats it
#: as untrustworthy. Judgement call, not evidence - the task's own author
#: doesn't have a base rate for how often vendor schemas tighten. Rationale:
#: schema-tightening incidents on record for this bundle are rare (one, so
#: far) but had zero warning and 100% request failure once they happened; a
#: monthly cadence catches drift within one ordinary release cycle without
#: demanding a live vendor call on every commit (this bundle ships far more
#: often than vendors change their computer-use schema).
MAX_AGE_DAYS = 30

#: Providers this bundle ships native support for TODAY (see providers.py's
#: DIALECTS) and therefore must carry a live attestation for. Gemini/Qwen are
#: deliberately out of scope (docs/phase2-plans.md Sec "Gemini and
#: Qwen") - the deferral is a decision already made and dated, not a gap.
