"""Unit tests for the held-input ledger (`ledger.py`) - the day-one safety
mechanism behind docs/remote-transport.md \u00a710.2.

No remote host, no subprocess, no real input injection - `release_fn` is a
plain recording callable. This is what proves "held-input ledger releases on
stream close" without touching a real desktop.
