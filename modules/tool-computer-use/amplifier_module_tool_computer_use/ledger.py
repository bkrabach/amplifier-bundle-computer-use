"""The held-input ledger: the most important safety property in the remote
transport (`docs/designs/remote-transport.md` \u00a710.2).

A synthetic keydown/mousedown with no matching up leaves a real human's
desktop broken, and the whole point of a remote agent is that the controller
cannot reach a machine whose link just died to fix it. So release must be
guaranteed *locally*, on the target, by the agent process itself - never by
the controller asking nicely.

This class is the ledger: a thread-safe registry of "what is currently held"
plus the release triggers required to be wired in from day one:

1. Explicit `release_all()` - the controller asking, or the agent's own
   stdin-EOF/signal handlers calling it.
2. A deadman timer - if nothing is heard from the controller for
   `deadman_seconds`, release everything and stop. Chosen in single digits
   (default 5s), not the 60s a first draft might reach for: this is a desktop
   a human is actively using, and 60 seconds of a stuck modifier key on a
   live machine is 60 seconds too many. 5s is comfortably longer than any
   Phase 1 request's real round trip (sub-second even for a screenshot) but
   short enough that a genuine, unnoticed disconnect resolves before anyone
   would think to ask "why is shift stuck".

No I/O of its own - callers supply a `release_fn` per held item and this class
guarantees it is called exactly once, from every trigger, in a way that is
race-safe if two triggers fire close together (e.g. EOF and the deadman).
