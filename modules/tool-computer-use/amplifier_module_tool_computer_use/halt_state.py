"""Durable, cross-session halt memory - the defect-2 fix.

`CoexistenceGuard` (`coexistence_guard.py`) is - by design and by
`test_halt_invariant.py::test_no_way_to_clear_a_latched_halt_from_the_guard_itself`
- a one-way latch: once `_halted` is set, nothing on the class can clear it.
The design's stated resume path is "a human clearing the halt through the one
channel that requires nothing of the controller at all - restarting a fresh
driving session after they choose to" (`coexistence_guard.py` module
docstring, citing `docs/coexistence.md` \u00a713 D3: "resume is manual
when a console user is present").

That sentence has an unstated assumption: that a "fresh driving session"
only ever begins because a human chose to start one. Real evaluation data
(`.amplifier/evaluation/computer-use/20260802T113341Z/s2-interrupt-halt/`)
shows that assumption does not hold. A `computer-operator` sub-agent halted
five times over ~57s (session `...23365dc078194312...`, all against the
SAME in-memory `CoexistenceGuard`, which correctly stayed halted for the
rest of that sub-agent's life - `_halted` is sticky, verified directly
against the shipped classes, not assumed). Control then returned to the
PARENT session (`...22d78f0d-c698-43aa-961a-506af4dc1d59...`), which mounts
its OWN `ComputerTool`/`CoexistenceGuard` - a brand-new instance with no
memory of the halt at all - and its first `left_click` succeeded 80s after
the first halt, entirely automatically. No human ever chose to resume
anything; the orchestrator simply started a new session on its own.

`CoexistenceGuard`'s in-memory latch (`presence.LATCH_DECAY_SECONDS`) has no
way to survive that boundary - it is a plain dataclass field on an object
that stops existing when its mount does. This module adds the missing
layer: a small durable, per-platform record written to disk the moment a
real human-detected halt fires, and consulted the moment a NEW guard is
about to be built (`_build_coexistence_guard` in `__init__.py`). If the
record is present, the new guard is seeded already-halted
(`CoexistenceGuard.seed_halted`) - so the unconditional halt invariant
(\u00a76.0) now holds ACROSS session/mount boundaries, not just within one.

The record is cleared by exactly one path: `clear_halt()`, called only by a
human-operated entry point (`scripts/resume_after_halt.py`) - never by any
code on the automated tool-call path. There is no time-based expiry here on
purpose: the task this module exists to satisfy is "resume requires an
explicit signal, not the mere passage of time." `presence.LATCH_DECAY_SECONDS`
keeps doing its own, unrelated job (converting noisy per-sample reads into a
stable IN-SESSION state, \u00a75.4) - this module does not touch it, read it, or
duplicate its role.

    (defect 2 - live safety defect, fixed 2026-08-02).

    Before this existed, the durable halt record was only ever consulted
    once, at mount time (`_build_coexistence_guard` in `__init__.py`). A
    guard mounted BEFORE some other session (e.g. a sub-agent, same backend)
    wrote a halt record could never learn about it - it kept its own
    in-memory `_halted=False` for its entire life, and every write it made
    after that point succeeded, exactly the defect this closes (see the
    module docstring above for the real evaluation evidence).

    The fix is to poll on every `before_event()` call, not just at
    construction - but `load_halt()` does a full file read + JSON parse,
    which is not something to pay on every elementary injected event
    (`docs/coexistence.md` \u00a75's per-sample cost budget: this
    mechanism already does an in-process idle read on that same hot path,
    and is sized in microseconds, not milliseconds). This closure keeps the
    common case - no halt has ever been recorded for this platform - down
    to exactly one `Path.stat()` syscall: `FileNotFoundError` short-circuits
    before any read or parse happens. The heavier `load_halt()` path runs at
    most ONCE per guard's lifetime: the moment it does run, the caller is
    expected to call `CoexistenceGuard.seed_halted()` (additive-only, never
    a clear), which flips `_halted` to `True` permanently - `before_event()`
    stops calling this poll at all once halted (see its own docstring), so
    there is nothing left to poll for the rest of that guard's life either
    way.

    Returns `None` when there is nothing to report (no record, or the
    caller should keep going) - never raises for the common "no file" case,
    since that is not a failure, it is the ordinary state of a machine
    nobody has been detected on.
