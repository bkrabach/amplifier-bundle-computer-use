"""WSL2 -> Windows desktop backend.

Every action crosses the WSL2/Win32 boundary through `bridge.ps1` via `powershell.exe`
interop - there is no in-process alternative for this boundary, so every method on
this backend necessarily subprocesses. Requests are handed over as a temp JSON file
(never as a -Command string) so no user text can be interpolated into a PowerShell
expression.

This module implements the `Backend` protocol (see `backend.py`). It is a mechanical
refactor of the original `WindowsBridge`: the wire format, the PowerShell invocation,
and every action's behavior are unchanged. It could not be exercised on this box (no
Windows target was available) - see the top-level report for what remains unverified.

        this Windows desktop, via `GetLastInputInfo`/`GetTickCount` on the far
        side of the WSL2 bridge - the `idle_source` the presence detector
        (`presence.PresenceMonitor`) reconciles against its own injection
        timestamps (\u00a75 of the coexistence design), the Windows counterpart to
        `LinuxX11Backend.presence_idle_ms`/`MacOSBackend.presence_idle_ms`.

        Unlike those two (a single in-process syscall, no subprocess), this
        crosses the WSL2->Win32 boundary via `powershell.exe`, exactly like
        every other action on this backend (\u00a75.5 - "Windows calls cross the
        WSL boundary via powershell.exe"). It is deliberately implemented as
        the CHEAPEST possible action dispatched through the SAME `bridge.ps1`
        script and the SAME `raw()` call path every other action already
        uses (`presence_idle` in `bridge.ps1`'s switch) - no new script, no
        new transport, no new mechanism - rather than inventing a persistent
        side-channel (that is Phase 4, tracked separately in `BACKLOG.md`).

        Honest cost note (\u00a75.5/\u00a712 "added powershell.exe spawns per action:
        zero" is a Linux/macOS-in-process property, not a Windows one): a
        correct presence read must be sampled fresh at call time - `idle_ms`
        cached from an earlier action's own response would be stale by
        however long has elapsed since that action completed, and plugging a
        stale sample into `PresenceMonitor.sample()`'s `now - idle_ms`
        reconciliation produces a WRONG (not just less-fresh) margin, which
        is the kind of silent, dangerous miss this whole feature exists to
        prevent (\u00a79.6 - never guess a fallback value). So this DOES add one
        additional `powershell.exe` spawn per guarded WRITE action on
        Windows (not per keystroke - `type_text` below does not accept a
        per-event guard, so this is capped at op granularity, matching
        \u00a75.5's \"Windows presence detection at op granularity is fine\").
        Eliminating that spawn requires either the Phase 4 persistent-
        PowerShell bridge, or moving the halt DECISION itself into
        `bridge.ps1` (a materially bigger redesign) - both out of scope here.

        Not part of the `Backend` protocol (`backend.py`) - looked up via
        `getattr` by whatever constructs the `CoexistenceGuard` for this
        backend, exactly like the Linux/macOS equivalents.
