"""Coordinate geometry shared by every computer-use backend.

Coordinate spaces
------------------
MODEL space  - what Claude sees and emits. Matches the downscaled screenshot exactly.
SCREEN space - real physical pixels of the desktop (a Windows virtual desktop, an X11
               root window, ...).

`Display.to_screen()` / `Display.to_model()` are the only places the two are converted.
This module is pure math - no I/O, no subprocess, no backend-specific knowledge - so it
is shared unchanged by every backend (`WindowsBackend`, `LinuxX11Backend`, ...).

    outside the screenshot the model was actually shown.

    `to_screen` used to clamp ANY coordinate - no matter how far outside the
    model's own image bounds - to the nearest valid screen pixel, and the
    action would then report success against whatever it happened to land
    on. A model coordinate hundreds of pixels outside the image it was shown
    is not a rounding artifact at an edge; it is real evidence of a
    mis-scaled screenshot, a stale monitor selection, or a provider
    coordinate-space mismatch - and silently clicking the nearest edge
    instead of surfacing that is exactly the kind of silent degradation this
    bundle otherwise refuses to allow (see
    `ComputerUseHookIncompatibleProviderError`,
    `ComputerUseNativeToolPassthroughUnsupportedError` in hook-computer-use).

    Coordinates within `_EDGE_TOLERANCE_PX` of the image bounds are still
    clamped, not raised - see that constant's docstring for why that band is
    legitimate. This is a `ValueError` subclass so it is caught by every
    existing `except (BackendError, ValueError)` handler in `ComputerTool._run`
    /`execute` without any change to that dispatch code, and reaches the model
    as an ordinary tool error it can react to (e.g. by requesting a fresh
    screenshot) rather than as a click that silently landed on the wrong
    target.

#: How far a MODEL-space coordinate may lie beyond the screenshot's own bounds
#: before `to_screen` treats it as a real error rather than a rounding/off-by-
#: one artifact. Judgement call, not evidence: `model_width`/`model_height`
#: THEMSELVES (one past the last valid 0-indexed pixel, e.g. x=1280 on a
#: 1280px-wide image) are always legitimate - that is the ordinary "used the
#: dimension instead of dimension-1" pattern models routinely produce at a
#: screen edge, and is exactly what `test_to_screen_scales_and_clamps` already
#: locks in. A couple more pixels of slack absorb sub-pixel rounding
#: differences across dialects (see `providers._normalize_gemini_action`'s
#: float-not-int comment: Gemini's 0..999 grid over an image lands fractions
#: of a pixel short of the true edge by construction, never past it - so this
#: tolerance is generous with room to spare for that case, not tuned tightly
#: to it). Anywhere past this band is not an edge - it is a different
#: coordinate space entirely, and clamping it there would click the wrong
#: target while reporting success.
